## üìñ Usage

### Target Management
- Add, edit, or delete targets by specifying IP addresses or domain names.

### Scanning
### Scanning

OffensiveGUI supports the following Nmap scan types:

- **TCP Connect Scan (-sT)**: Establishes a full TCP connection to detect open ports.
- **SYN Scan (-sS)**: Performs a half-open scan, sending SYN packets to identify open ports without completing the handshake.
- **UDP Scan (-sU)**: Scans for open UDP ports by sending UDP packets to targets.
- **XMAS Scan (-sX)**: Sends packets with unusual flags to detect closed ports based on responses.
- **FIN Scan (-sF)**: Sends FIN packets to the target, attempting to bypass firewalls and detect open ports based on the lack of response.
- **NULL Scan (-sN)**: Sends packets with no flags set to identify closed ports based on responses.
- **ACK Scan (-sA)**: Maps firewall rules by analyzing responses to ACK packets.
- **Window Scan (-sW)**: Uses TCP window size to differentiate between open and closed ports.
- **Maimon Scan (-sM)**: Sends FIN/ACK packets to detect open ports on certain systems.
- **Service Version Detection (-sV)**: Identifies services and their versions running on open ports.
- **OS Fingerprinting (-O)**: Determines the operating system of the target based on network responses.
- **Aggressive Scan (-A)**: Combines OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute for detailed results.
- **Idle Scan (-sI)**: Uses a third-party host to perform a stealthy scan of the target.
- **Ping Scan (-sn)**: Discovers live hosts without performing a port scan.
- **Script Scan (--script)**: Executes Nmap scripts for vulnerability detection and additional information gathering.
- **Traceroute (--traceroute)**: Maps the network path to the target.

These scan types provide flexibility for various network analysis needs.

### Database Management
- Clear or rebuild the database as needed.

### Logging
- View and filter logs by date, target, or action type.

### Dashboard
- Monitor target statuses and recent actions in real-time.

### User Management
- Assign roles and permissions using the RBAC system.

### Theme Customization
- Switch between light and dark modes for a personalized experience.
